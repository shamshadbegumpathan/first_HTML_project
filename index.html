    <dt><strong><em>Coffee</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>Coffee is more than just a beverage—it’s a daily ritual that brings comfort, focus, and connection. From the rich aroma
    of freshly ground beans to the first warm sip, coffee awakens the senses and sets the tone for the day. Grown in diverse
    regions around the world, each cup carries unique flavors shaped by its origin, roast, and brewing method. Whether
    enjoyed alone during a quiet moment or shared in conversation at a café, coffee has a way of slowing time, sparking
    ideas, and turning ordinary moments into something special. ☕

<dt><strong><em>Cappuccino</em></strong></dt>
<dd>Cappuccino is a classic coffee drink known for its perfect balance of bold espresso, steamed milk, and light, airy milk
foam. With its rich flavor and creamy texture, it offers a smooth yet strong taste that coffee lovers enjoy at any time
of day. Traditionally served hot, a cappuccino is as much about the experience as the flavor—the comforting warmth, the
delicate foam, and often a touch of art on top make it a favorite choice in cafés around the world. ☕
